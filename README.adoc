= Pipchix

Pipchix is currently under development.

Here is a quick guide to how one might use Pipchix to write NixOS
configurations, once Pipchix is sufficiently developed.

CHICKEN 5:: Install the NixOS packages +chicken+,
  +chickenPackages.chickenEggs.utf8+, and
  +chickenPackages.chickenEggs.r7rs+. Configure Pipchix, preferably
  for an out-of-source build. Do +make dist-chicken-egg-5+, which
  should produce a compressed tar file. Untar the file into your
  +/etc/nixos+ or equivalent directory. Run +chicken-install -n+ to
  build the egg in place. Now you can run CHICKEN scripts in
  +/etc/nixos+ that import R⁷RS Pipchix libraries.

  Please remember that CHICKEN 5 is not an R⁷RS implementation. It
  does not, for instance, recognize the same syntax for escapes in
  strings. CHICKEN 6 will be an R⁷RS implementation, but does not work
  yet with Pipchix (as of 2025-11-26).
